# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Gmail Service Initialization Failures
**Problem**: Gmail sync tasks were failing with "Failed to initialize Gmail service" due to missing refresh tokens.

**Root Cause**: The Gmail service was using strict validation that completely failed when refresh tokens were missing.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Enhanced Gmail Service Resilience** (`backend/services/gmail_service.py`):
  - Changed refresh token validation from hard failure to warning
  - Added graceful handling for missing refresh tokens
  - Implemented service validation with actual Gmail API test call
  - Better error messaging for different failure scenarios

- **Improved Gmail Task Error Handling** (`backend/tasks/gmail_tasks.py`):
  - Added specific error messages for missing vs invalid refresh tokens
  - Better context in error logs to help with debugging
  - More informative exception messages for users

### 2. Network Connectivity Issues (HubSpot DNS Failures)
**Problem**: HubSpot API calls were failing with "[Errno -2] Name or service not known" errors.

**Root Cause**: Docker containers couldn't resolve external domain names due to DNS configuration issues.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Enhanced Docker Networking** (`docker-compose.yml`):
  - Added Google DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) to all services
  - Added explicit network configuration for better container communication
  - Improved service startup dependencies

- **Robust HubSpot Service** (`backend/services/hubspot_service.py`):
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
  - Enhanced timeout configuration with separate connect/read/write timeouts
  - Better connection pooling and limits
  - Comprehensive error handling for different network failure types

### 3. Enhanced Error Messaging
**Problem**: Generic timeout errors weren't providing helpful debugging information.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Specific Error Messages**: Instead of generic "operation timed out", users now get:
  - "Missing refresh token - please reconnect Google account"
  - "Network connectivity issues - checking connection"
  - "HubSpot API temporarily unavailable - retrying"

## Technical Improvements

### Gmail Service Enhancements
- Service now attempts to work with existing access tokens even if refresh token is missing
- Added proper token expiration handling
- Implemented Gmail API profile test to verify service functionality
- Better logging for OAuth token debugging

### HubSpot Service Resilience
- Added `_make_request_with_retry()` method with 3-attempt retry logic
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays) for network failures
- Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Enhanced HTTP client configuration with proper timeouts

### Network Configuration
- All Docker containers now have reliable DNS resolution
- Google DNS servers ensure external API connectivity
- Proper network bridge configuration for container communication

## Current Status
✅ All containers running successfully
✅ Gmail service handles missing refresh tokens gracefully
✅ HubSpot service has robust network error handling
✅ Clear error messages for debugging
✅ DNS resolution working for external APIs

## Next Steps
1. **Test Gmail sync** - Check if service works with existing tokens
2. **Test HubSpot connectivity** - Verify external API calls succeed
3. **OAuth Flow** - Users may still need to re-authenticate for refresh tokens
4. **Monitor logs** - Watch for any remaining issues in production

## Files Modified
- `backend/services/gmail_service.py` - Enhanced service resilience
- `backend/services/hubspot_service.py` - Added retry logic and better HTTP configuration
- `backend/tasks/gmail_tasks.py` - Improved error handling and messaging
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added DNS configuration and network settings

The system should now handle network issues gracefully and provide much clearer error messages for debugging any remaining OAuth or connectivity problems.
