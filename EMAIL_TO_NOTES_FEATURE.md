# Email Content as HubSpot Notes Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically captures email content and adds it as notes to HubSpot contacts when they are created from incoming emails. This provides valuable context about why each contact was added to your CRM.

## How It Works

### üîÑ **Automatic Email Processing**

1. **Email Detection**: Gmail polling service monitors your inbox every 30 seconds
2. **Unknown Sender Detection**: When an email arrives from a sender not in your HubSpot contacts
3. **Contact Creation**: System creates a new HubSpot contact for the sender
4. **üìù Email Note Creation**: System automatically adds the email content as a note to the contact
5. **Thank You Email**: System sends automatic thank you email to the new contact

### üìß **Email Note Format**

When a contact is created from an email, the system adds a formatted note containing:

```
üìß Initial Contact via Email
Received: December 16, 2024 at 2:30 PM
From: john@company.com (John Smith)
Subject: Potential collaboration opportunity

Email Content:
Hi there,

I came across your company and am interested in exploring potential collaboration opportunities. We're a technology company specializing in AI solutions and think there might be synergy between our businesses.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss?

Best regards,
